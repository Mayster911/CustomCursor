# CustomCursor
A mod for SpiderHeck to replace the cursor with anything.

# Installation
Follow the excellent instructions from SpiderHeck's Discord: https://discord.com/channels/723473254559514686/1067568618663051424

In your local SpiderHeck installation find `BepInEx/plugins/CustomCursor/cursor.png`.
The file with this exact name will be used as the cursor, replace as necessary. Be aware that the hotspot is always at half height and half width of the bitmap.
